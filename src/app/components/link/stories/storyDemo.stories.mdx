# StoryBook Documentation

While Storybook already offers numerous advantages, the addition of the docs plugin further enhances its value. One of the key benefits of Storybook Docs is the  ability to maintain component documentation in close proximity to the code, simplifying  maintenance and updates as the project evolves. Developers can seamlessly incorporate  documentation into Stories using markdown files.

# About - StoryBook 

This documentation encompasses various aspects of the component, including its description, intended behavior, recommended usage scenarios, props and their types, and even interactive examples showcasing the component's functionality. Additionally, Storybook Docs supports global documentation, providing a centralized space to document guidelines and best practices for the entire component library.

The resulting perks are remarkable: a unified source of truth as all component-related information is stored and managed in a single location. The documentation is readily accessible through the published Storybook web app. Furthermore, Storybook's editability is limited to developers, ensuring that any modifications to styling guidelines or a component's appearance cannot be made without the developers' awareness. All additions and changes must be deliberated by designers and developers, passing through the development team's approval process before being incorporated into Storybook.
